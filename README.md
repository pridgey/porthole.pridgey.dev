## porthole.pridgey.dev

A project to display the current date, an inspiration line or two, the current weather and a list of events from Google Calendar.
This was a personal project to display a quick go-to screen for info about the day. As such, it was done sloppily and without regard to anyone else who'd really want to use it.
If this gets any kind of traction I can generalize it, but for now please don't pull this down expecting it to work for you. Sorry. I'll do better next time.
